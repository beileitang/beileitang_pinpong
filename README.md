# Creating a simple Pong game

how to play it:
Pressing the ‘w’ key will cause the left paddle to move up.
Pressing the ‘s’ key will cause the left paddle to move down.
Pressing the ‘o’ key will cause the right paddle to move up.
Pressing the ‘k’ key will cause the right paddle to move down.
Gameplay:
When the program runs, the ball will start moving left.
When the ball hits a paddle or the top/bottom of the screen, it should bounce off in an appropriate direction.
A score variable for each of the left and right players should be created to keep track of score.
When a player misses the ball, the other player’s score should increase and the ball should be returned to its starting position.
